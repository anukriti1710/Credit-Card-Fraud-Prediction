# Credit-Card-Fraud-Prediction
Credit Card Fraud is the most common kind of identity theft with an estimated 1.5 billion credit cards in the United States alone. The aim of this project is to analyze a Kaggle dataset related to fraudulent transactions with over 55,000 records from different cities in the United States and build predictive models. Also, the following questions were answered with the help of this analysis: <br>
•	Does age affect the frequency of credit card frauds? In other words, are older people more vulnerable to frauds?
•	Does the selection of a credit card provider impact the likelihood of experiencing credit card fraud?
•	Which is the best predictive model to detect fraudulent transactions?
